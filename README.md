# Deadlock Detection in C

![C Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C-blue.svg)

## Overview

This project provides an implementation of a deadlock detection algorithm in C. Deadlocks are a critical issue in concurrent systems where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources. This project aims to detect such deadlocks to ensure the smooth execution of concurrent processes.

## Features

- Implementation of deadlock detection algorithms.
- Sample test cases to demonstrate the detection of deadlocks.
- Easy to understand and modify codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ronald-hove/deadlock-detection-in-c.git
    cd deadlock-detection-in-c
    ```

2. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    gcc -o deadlock_detection main.c
    ```

3. Run the executable:

    ```bash
    ./deadlock_detection
    ```

## Usage

Modify `main.c` to add or modify test cases for deadlock detection. The current implementation includes sample processes and resource allocation to demonstrate the functionality.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
